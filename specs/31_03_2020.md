# BCDB Reboot

## Agenda

- Overall design/architecture
- Choice of tech
- Basic specs for each component
- Execution plan, task and work distribution

### Storage layer

- 0-DB is used as storage engine
  - check if we can embed libzdb directly to avoid the network overhead
- Data is stored as opaque byte blob
- Possibility to have schema and schema-less collection
- Each collection is stored into a 0-db namespace

### Tech

- With schema enabled collection, encoding is enforced. encoding To be defined.

### Metadata layer

- Metadata
  - client sends metadata next to the actual data. Metadata gets indexed into a b-tree/graph
  - metadata format
    ```go
    type Tag struct {
        Key string
        Value interface{}
        ObjID uint64
    }
    ```
  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html
- Full text search
  - using [Sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic) as database
  - Configure your collection to make it aware BCDB has to full text index a certain field of the data blob. This requires the user to specify the schema and encoding of the collection so BCDB can deserialize the data blob.

### Communication layer

- Data flow
  - set: write data get an ID back, optionally with metadata
  - update: write data on a existing ID
  - get: read data from an ID
  - list: return all the ids contained in a collections
  - delete: mark ID as deleted

- Metadata
  - update: metadata of existing objects
  - delete: remove metadata from index
  - queries: ....

### Questions

- What happened when a write trigger the spread of 0-DB files which generate metadata which trigger more spreading ?
- How do we want to implement transactions ? Do we need ACID ?
- What's the status of grpc with wasm and javascript in general
- How do we implement root of trust ?
  - can we run multiple explorer ? What about uniqueness of phone-book information then

### Execution plan

- Week 1
  - Storage layer:
    - create schema-less collection
    - write/read data from a collection
  - Metadata layer:
    - indexed tag system
  - Communication layer
    - define grpc service
    - generate server and client
  - Milestone: Starting the server, client can write and retrieve data by ID
- Week 2
  - Storage layer:
    - finish design for schema-full collection
    - spec how to communicate schema definition from client to server
    - spec how to create native struct to deserialize object server side
  - Metadata layer:
    - Adding of sonic support for full test search
  - Communication layer:
    - research trust and authentication system
  - Milestone: Client can configure a schema-full collection and do queries on metadata
