### How to use
- Make sure you create a user on the explorer (https://explorer.devnet.grid.tf/) using the `tfuser` tool
- Use the seed to start bcdb as per documentation, starting bcdb with your own private seed will make bcdb only accept access from you
- bcfiles uses the same seed file format as generated by `tfuser`

### Upload files
bcfiles will create the required directories for you so u can start uploading files immediately

example
```bash
export SEED_FILE=/path/to/your/seed/file

bcfiles put /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

bcfiles ls
   9	30 Apr 20 12:46 EET	0	etc

bcfiles ls etc
  10	30 Apr 20 12:46 EET	107	resolv.conf

bcfiles cat etc/resolv.conf
